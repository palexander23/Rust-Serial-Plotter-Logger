# Rust Serial Plotter/Logger (Plogger)

## !!WIP: This app is under slow, irregular construction.

A native app for simultaneously plotting and logging data gathered over Serial.

## Goals
### Required:
[✓] Nice looking plot of serial data.  
[ ] Simultaneous saving of raw log data.  

### Nice to have:
[ ] Configurable plot look.  
[✓] Automatic configuration of line number.  
[ ] Configurable output filtering (a la log-converter).
